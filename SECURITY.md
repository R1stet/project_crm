# Security Implementation Guide

## Environment Setup

### 1. Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Supabase credentials:

```bash
# Copy from .env.example and fill in your values
cp .env.example .env.local
```

**IMPORTANT**: Never commit `.env.local` to version control. The `.gitignore` file already excludes this.

### 2. Supabase Security Configuration

#### Row Level Security (RLS)
Enable RLS on your `customers` table in Supabase:

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.customers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy for authenticated users to see only their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own customers" ON public.customers
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid()::text = created_by);

-- Policy for authenticated users to insert their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own customers" ON public.customers
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = created_by);

-- Policy for authenticated users to update their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own customers" ON public.customers
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid()::text = created_by);

-- Policy for authenticated users to delete their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own customers" ON public.customers
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid()::text = created_by);
```

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication Security
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: 5 failed attempts per 15 minutes per email
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Email and password validation using Zod
- ✅ **Error Sanitization**: Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- ✅ **Session Management**: 30-minute timeout with 5-minute warning

### 2. Data Protection
- ✅ **Input Sanitization**: Search queries sanitized to prevent SQL injection
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Database errors sanitized before showing to users
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict validation

### 3. Security Headers
- ✅ **Content Security Policy**: Restricts resource loading
- ✅ **XSS Protection**: Multiple layers including headers and sanitization
- ✅ **Frame Protection**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- ✅ **HTTPS Enforcement**: Upgrade insecure requests

### 4. Session Security
- ✅ **Auto-logout**: Inactive sessions terminated after 30 minutes
- ✅ **Activity Tracking**: Mouse, keyboard, and scroll events tracked
- ✅ **Session Extension**: Users can extend sessions before timeout
- ✅ **Secure Cookies**: Supabase configured with secure session handling

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Set up proper environment variables in your hosting platform
- [ ] Enable Supabase Row Level Security policies
- [ ] Configure HTTPS on your domain
- [ ] Set up monitoring for security events
- [ ] Review and test all authentication flows
- [ ] Verify CSP headers don't break functionality

### Monitoring
The application logs security events to the console:
- Failed login attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Session timeouts
- Database errors

In production, configure proper logging and monitoring to track these events.

### Additional Security Recommendations
1. **Regular Security Audits**: Run `npm audit` regularly
2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated
3. **Supabase Security**: Review Supabase security settings regularly
4. **Access Logs**: Monitor access patterns for suspicious activity
5. **Backup Strategy**: Implement regular database backups
